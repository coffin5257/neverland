neverland
===========

a wordpress theme  for ikde.org

it's @csslayer who branched kde-breathe from wordpress default theme: twentyten. I branched it again to make it elegant looking and functional, matching the new kde theme neverland.

I removed a lot of unneeded functions, added codes respect Chinese users tastes(eg: they do not use categories and tags that much). and useful and better looking widgets.
